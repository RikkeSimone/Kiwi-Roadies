## Goals

### MVP

* Pre-draw 3 kiwi destinations on a map
* Build a form that generates your road trip based on your start location, end location, number of days  
* API's for the New Zealand base map - flying cameras, DOC 
* App animates a name and travel journey across the client side

### Stretch Goals 

* Map icons of bike trails, camp sites, possibly trails and huts. This will show based on zoom focus
* Send/share your trip with others - screen shot, PDF, email, Export it
* Directions on the map
* Scrolling on the map triggers location change, with that has associated information such as links
* Have more activity preferences available such as beaches - may require additonal API
* Tag pictures of your trip to sites
* Home by a certain date/time (this factors into your roadie as a whole)
* Sign-in & Authorisation
* Radio Jingle
* Trains
